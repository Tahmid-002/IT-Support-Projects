Windows Active Directory Home Lab Project

Objective
To design and deploy a functional **Windows Server Active Directory environment** in a virtualized lab setup for learning, testing, and demonstration of IT support and system administration skills.

Environment Setup
Platform: Oracle VirtualBox  

Virtual Machines:
- 22 (Windows Server 2022)– Domain Controller  
- client11 (Windows 11)** – Domain-joined workstation  

Network Configuration:
- Adapter 1 (Bridged): Internet access  
- Adapter 2 (Host-Only): Internal network between VMs  
- Static IP (22): 192.168.2.61  
- Static IP (client11): 192.168.2.69 
- DNS Server (Client): 192.168.2.61


Configuration Steps
1. Installed **VirtualBox** and created two virtual machines.  
2. Installed **Windows Server 2022** on 22 and **Windows 11** on client11.  
3. Promoted DC01 to a **Domain Controller** and created a new forest: `TJORG.COM`.  
4. Installed **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**.  
5. Created an **Organizational Unit (OU)** named `Sales` and under 'Sales' i created another 2 more OU named 'tech' and 'Home'.  
6. Added domain users under 'Home':
   - HomeSales1  
   - Home Sales2 
7. Configured **DNS** so CLIENT11 uses 22 as its primary DNS server.  
8. Joined **CLIENT11** to the **TJORG.COM** domain.  
9. Verified successful domain login using a domain user account.  
10. Tested basic network connectivity and authentication.
