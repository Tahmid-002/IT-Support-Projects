Windows Active Directory Home Lab Project

Objective
To design and deploy a functional **Windows Server Active Directory environment** in a virtualized lab setup for learning, testing, and demonstration of IT support and system administration skills.

Environment Setup
Platform: Oracle VirtualBox  

Virtual Machines:
- DC01 (Windows Server 2022)– Domain Controller  
- CLIENT01 (Windows 11)** – Domain-joined workstation  

Network Configuration:
- Adapter 1 (Bridged): Internet access  
- Adapter 2 (Host-Only): Internal network between VMs  
- Static IP (DC01): 192.168.56.10  
- Static IP (CLIENT01): 192.168.56.11  
- DNS Server (Client): 192.168.56.10


Configuration Steps
1. Installed **VirtualBox** and created two virtual machines.  
2. Installed **Windows Server 2022** on DC01 and **Windows 11** on CLIENT01.  
3. Promoted DC01 to a **Domain Controller** and created a new forest: `TJORG.COM`.  
4. Installed **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**.  
5. Created an **Organizational Unit (OU)** named `LabUsers`.  
6. Added domain users:
   - JohnDoe  
   - JaneSmith  
7. Configured **DNS** so CLIENT01 uses DC01 as its primary DNS server.  
8. Joined **CLIENT01** to the **lab.local** domain.  
9. Verified successful domain login using a domain user account.  
10. Tested basic network connectivity and authentication.
